# ghc-plugs-out
ThisÂ package's GHC plugins that do not behave well. They have undefined
implementations for plugin functions init, solve and stop. When GHC calls into
any of these plugins it panics. This can be seen by compiling one of the test
suites.

```
> cabal build undefined-init-invoke
[1 of 1] Compiling Undefined.Init.Plugin
[1 of 1] Compiling Main
ghc: panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
Please report this as a GHC bug:  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug
```

```
> stack test ghc-plugs-out:undefined-stop-invoke
